Question 1.
The first value that I notice that affects the time at all is 1000.
Question 2.
the first number that gave me a time is 1500
Question 3. 
The second function is faster after testing I think its faster because it
only uses one for loop.
Question 4
I think the second one will run faster because iterative code runs faster then 
recursive.
Question 5.
The second function was faster then the first I think its faster because its 
iterative and not recursive.
